# RESTfulAPI

Jul 2022 - First time working ot make a RESTful API

Wiki-style API: done on my local computer it had a few Shoujo Manga and their synopsiss in them so I could test the get, post, update and delete functionality of the API

- Written in JavaScript
- No front-end, Postman used for testing and HTTP commands
- Node and Express back-end
- MongoDB with Studio 3T

This was very interesting to play with and while it is not deployed or have much in it I got a great appreciation for API and it sent me down a googling path to see all the things that use API that I currently use.

I learn that so many company's and apps that I am using have API's and can be used to build off of. So While this was just the first it would be really interesting to build a more functional API or use and exisiting one to test my understanding and functionality.
